# Proto-Project
## Repo for the Prototype of my NEA Comp Sci Project
This is to keep track of all versions of my prototype as a back up if anything goes wrong.
###
This repo is for prototyping my NEA Project, a barebones basic 2D fighting Game.
It contains the various files that I will be using in my prototype.
###
For this, I will be following some basic Youtube tutorials to help me learn the basics as well as construct this protoype.
